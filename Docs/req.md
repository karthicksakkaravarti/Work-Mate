## 🧠 **Core Features**

### 1. **Break Reminders**

* **Micro-breaks**: Short breaks (e.g. 30 seconds every 10 minutes).
* **Regular breaks**: Longer breaks (e.g. 5-10 minutes every hour).
* **Custom intervals**: Users can set their own schedules.

### 2. **Break Types**

* **Full screen dim or overlay**: Gently forces user to stop by covering the screen.
